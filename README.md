Welcome to the **Data Analysis** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring, analysing, and visualising data using Jupyter Notebooks. All resources in this repository are created to help with understanding datasets, applying statistical methods, and generating insights in an interactive and reproducible manner.

## Repository Structure

All code and documentation are provided as Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`), making it easy to follow along and experiment with the data analysis steps.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhuvana214/data-analysis.git
   cd data-analysis
   ```

2. **Open Notebooks:**
   - Make sure you have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed.
   - Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal or use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Jupyter extension.

## Features

- Interactive data analysis using Jupyter Notebook
- Step-by-step data cleaning, visualisation, and modeling
- Reproducible workflows for various data science projects

## Requirements

- Python (recommend >=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook

Additional requirements may be specified in individual notebook files.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you would like to add notebooks, suggest improvements, or fix bugs.
